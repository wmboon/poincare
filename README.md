Source code to reproduce the numerical results for the paper [Solvers for mixed finite element problems using Poincar√© operators based on spanning trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08830).

The code currently depends on the [poincare branch](https://github.com/compgeo-mox/pygeon/tree/poincare) of PyGeoN. This will be merged into the main branch into the future.
